> We loved with a love that was more than love

Another aspect of my research focuses on the tazkirah. Senior scholars translate this term as “memorative communication” to foreground their link with memory and history. There is no exact equivalent of this textual genre in the English-speaking context so I like to think of them as biographical diaries. Throughout the mushairah’s history listeners, patrons, and poets carried small note books with them to record verse and particulars of poets and their recitations in gatherings. These diaries often formed the foundations of famous tazkirahs written over the seventeenth, eighteenth, and early nineteenth centuries. New research, including mine, brings a fresh look to the tazkirah to help us better understand the social, cultural, and historical these texts make. A larger project I am now just beginning aims to digitize Urdu and Persian language tazkirahs to make them available and searchable for students, researchers, and enthusiasts of Persian and Urdu verse and its many poets.
