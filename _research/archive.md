Another aspect of my research focuses on the tazkirah. Senior scholars translate this term as “memorative communication” to link the tazkirah with memory and history, concepts woven into the meaning of this Arabic word. There is no exact equivalent of this textual genre in the English-speaking context so I like to think of the tazkirah as a more formalized diary. Throughout the mushairah’s history listeners, patrons, and poets carried small notebooks with them to gatherings with the purpose of recording verse, poets’ particulars, and maybe a novel occurrence that would form the basis of an anecdote or joke. These notebooks would often become the foundations for particular tazkirahs written over the seventeenth, eighteenth, and early nineteenth centuries.

New research, including mine, brings a fresh look to the tazkirah, helping us better understand the social, cultural, and historical contributions these texts make. An extended project I am now beginning aims to digitize Urdu and Persian language tazkirahs to make them available and searchable for students, researchers, and enthusiasts of Persian and Urdu literature and their many poets. Digitized tazkirahs can be translated into visual representations using social network mapping software. In some of the images below, I used the program Gephi to diagram the the social network archived in Ghulam Hamdani Mushafi’s tazkirah *Riyāl al-Fushā*.
