Contemporary Urdu poetry gatherings or mushairahs are visually rich affairs. Viewers expect the poets to adhere to polite and entertaining modes of decorum and ways of speaking. Yet, it would seem the mushairah’s visual elements parallel these linguistic and decorous elements. In this site, the poets’ gestures and styles of speech in addition to the decorations can help to translate the event for viewers not familiar with Urdu language. When I shot the footage and took the pictures I was often one of many camera operators among dozens of media personnel documenting these epic, entertaining, and engrossing gatherings.
