South Asia houses the world’s largest population of Muslims whose experiences, outlook, and practices vary across regional, ethnic, class, and gender lines. My research so far has focused on Urdu and Hindi speaking populations in urban and semi-urban locales. Here you’ll find some of my ethnographic images of Muslim India shot over about a decade during various grad and undergrad research trips.
