        <p>I was born in Orange County and raised in the Inland Empire of Southern California. I received my BA (Honors) (2002) from the University of Redlands Johnston Center and my M. Mus. (2005) in Musicology/Ethnomusicology at the University of Texas at Austin. After focusing on Urdu and Persian literature and language in Lucknow, India, I returned to Texas to study under Syed Akbar Hyder at UT’s Department of Asian Studies. I recently completed my PhD in the winter of 2014 and I now teach at Western Michigan University’s Lee Honors College and Department of Comparative Religion. </p>
        <p>My current book manuscript is based on over three years of ethnographic and archival research conducted for my dissertation. It is tentatively titled, "A Market for Speech: The Literary Salon in 1700s India and Iran." This study examines entertaining anecdotes about literary salons and their controversial verse as recited, circulated, and memorialized by Urdu and Persian poets in late-Mughal and Safavid cities and towns. This work takes a material approach to literature as a social process that shaped a unique pre-colonial public sphere according to the lyrical intentions of Persian and vernacular ideals.</p>
